HI,
Myself Rishika Raj Sukumaran. I belong to CSE AI Batch. 
I have been really keen to join ACM club. I am passionately trying to learn new things from the time I have registered to this club.
The tasks seemed Interesting in the beginning while I felt it difficult at some point of time but I was ready to work for it nevertheless.
Working and designing in Tinkercad was an entirely new experience. Though I didnt know how to do the designing of logic gates, I learnt it through references from youtube and learnt about the pin configurations from google.
Task 3 was difficult as a beginner but again I learnt many new things from it but I couldnt solve all of them though I did try doing each one of them.
I chose SIG CP so I did the problems from hackerrank contest and I tried the problems through c language. I could do 3 problems in it.
I might not be the best among all who have joined the club but I am surely the one who wishes to never leave spirit and work with passion until it bears fruits.
This is what I can do for the club as well. 
Hoping to be a part of the team soon!!
Thank you
